            Surabaya is the second-largest city in Indonesia, located on the northeastern coast of Java Island. It serves as the capital of East Java province and is an important hub for business, education, and culture in Indonesia. 
            The city has a rich history, dating back to its role as a major trading port in the era of the Majapahit Kingdom, and later, during the colonial period under Dutch rule.
            <br><br>
            Surabaya is often referred to as the "City of Heroes" (Kota Pahlawan) due to its significant role in Indonesia's struggle for independence, particularly during the Battle of Surabaya in 1945, a major conflict between Indonesian freedom fighters and British forces.
            <br><br>
            Today, Surabaya is a modern metropolis with a blend of historical landmarks and contemporary urban developments. Notable sites include Tugu Pahlawan (Heroes Monument) and Jembatan Suramadu (connecting Java and Madura Island), reflecting the city's rich multicultural heritage. 
            Its bustling ports and industries make it a key player in Indonesia's economy, while its parks and green spaces offer a balance to the urban environment.
            <br><br>
            Surabaya is also known for its cuisine, such as rawon (a traditional beef soup) and rujak cingur (a salad with a special fermented shrimp paste dressing), showcasing the diverse flavors of East Javanese food. 
            With its vibrant atmosphere, historical significance, and growing economy, Surabaya is a dynamic city blending tradition with modernity.
